"Don't call us, we'll call you", Hollywood principle

[@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection Dependency injection] is a [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern software design pattern] that implements [@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control inversion of control] and allows a program design to follow the dependency inversion principle.

testable code, separation between business logic and object creation

Form of dependency injection:
constructor injection
setter injection
member injection
interface injection
